PyNSource is a python code scanner and UML modelling tool.

Reverse engineer python source code into UML - display UML as Ascii art or in a proper diagramming visual workspace

## Features ##

  * Recognises inheritance and composition  relationships
  * Detects the cardinality of associations e.g. one to one or 1..`*`  etc
  * Optionally treat modules as classes - creating a pseudo class for each module - module variables and functions are  treated as attributes and methods of a class
  * Has been developed using unit tests (supplied) so that you can trust it just that little bit more ;-)
  * Free

  * A python code scanner and UML modelling tool that generates UML diagram models that you can layout, arrange and print out.

  * Also generates UML text diagrams, which you can paste into your source code for documentation purposes.

  * Also generates Java or Delphi code (which can be subsequently imported into more sophisticated UML modelling tools).
