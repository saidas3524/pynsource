# Introduction #

  * Resilient: doesn't import the python files, thus will never get "stuck" when syntax is wrong.
  * Fast
  * Recognises inheritance and composition  relationships
  * Detects the cardinality of associations e.g. one to one or 1..`*`  etc
  * Optionally treat modules as classes - creating a pseudo class for each module - module variables and functions are  treated as attributes and methods of a class
  * Has been developed using unit tests (supplied) so that you can trust it just that little bit more ;-)
  * Free
